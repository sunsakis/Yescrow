            <p>
            Let me show you that it is completely possible to protect yourself from an online scammer by using an escrow as if it were your scam shield. For free. Absolutely for free. Can’t believe it? Yes, this trick is that mighty. So bear with me as I show you how to navigate the matrix.
            </p>

            <p>
            I just received an e-mail. In it, it said: "If you would like to rank your product in the top position of Producthunt.com, please contact me. It is totally organic and safe method."
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
            Now you probably do understand I had some suspicions about this here. Should I send the dude some money to rank? How can I know he does not walk away from the deal? After all, all I got is his e-mail, which is not much…
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
            However, I did reply to the man on the other side of the wire. "Hello, Heron! Sure. How much would you like me to escrow you for the service? As soon as the product is ranked in the top position, as you suggested - I will release the money to you."
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Let me just say, the guy has not responded yet…
                <i>Edit:</i> The guy responded, told me the sum to escrow, now I know he is legit.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
            In case he would not have gotten back to me after I mentioned I am ready to escrow him the payment, I would have know the guy to be a sham. Also, if he were to start yapping about how he does not want to use an escrow - scam alert!

            Understanding Yes Crow - A Powerful Crypto Escrow Tool Living On Ethereum
            </h2>
            <br/>
            <p>
            Escrow is an agreement in which a third party holds the funds until the conditions of the deal are fulfilled, properly. In the case of Yes Crow, the funds are held on a smart contract that lives on the Ethereum`s blockchain. It is a simple logic written in code, public and verified to be unbreakable. No one can change it. You don’t need to trust Yes Crow, only trust in logic. To use Yes Crow, all you need to do is install MetaMask - an extension of your browser. If you do not have MetaMask installed, just click on “Connect Wallet” that you see at the top right of the page and follow the lead. 
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
            By creating a MetaMask account, you automatically get an Ethereum wallet, so that’s two birds - one shot. And voila, welcome aboard the New World Wide Web, where you are your own bank and only you are responsible for your own funds. This does come with some caveats, but the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
            Now you can use MetaMask to sign transactions and escrow crypto dollars (stablecoins), Ether, or any other tokens on the Ethereum’s blockchain. If you would like to send an escrow, however, you will need to get some ETH (Ether) in your wallet to pay for gas. Every transaction on Ethereum’s blockchain costs gas, but the way we see it is that it costs a little bit to be in total control over your money. And these fees, they are 100x lower than traditional escrow services.

            <h3>So what is escrow, exactly?</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>
            Escrow is a financial arrangement where a third party holds and regulates the funds until a transaction between two parties is completed. Acting as a neutral intermediary, the escrow service ensures that both parties fulfill their obligations, mitigating the risks associated with fraudulent activities.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
            Our newly developed escrow tool is a cutting-edge solution designed to provide enhanced security and peace of mind in online transactions. The escrow smart contract logic is open-source and made free to use because we believe that it would be unethical to earn money for doing nothing (once the smart contract is deployed, it can be used indefinitely without any wear and tear). However, in case something goes wrong and you would like to return or release the escrow, then you contact us and Yes Crow collects relevant data and acts as arbitrage. So in case of bad luck and some party not fulfilling their obligations, you would lose 5% of your escrow as our arbitrage fee, however, you still get to keep 95% of the payment, which is nothing for a fraudster to smile about.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
            By offering an additional layer of protection, this tool aims to prevent scams and foster truth and trust among parties involved. By being a bankless solution, we cut usage costs and pass it on to the users. Where else can you escrow for the equivalent of $10 bucks? This is the price you would pay for gas if you wanted to make an Ether escrow today, and with time as Ethereum Virtual Machine is being improved, the gas prices seem to be getting even lower.
