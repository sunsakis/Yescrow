                    I just got an e-mail:

                    Thanks``
                    <br /><br />
                    To which I responded:

                    ``Hello, Heron!
                    Sure. How much would you like me to escrow you for the service?
                    As soon as the product is ranked in top position, as you suggested - I will release the money to you.

                    Yours Sincerely,

                    Edit: The guy responded, told me the sum to escrow, now I know he is legit.</p><br />
                    <h2>Understanding Escrow:</h2>
                    <p>
                    Escrow is a financial arrangement where a third party holds and regulates funds until a transaction between two parties is completed. Acting as a neutral intermediary, the escrow service ensures that both parties fulfill their obligations, mitigating the risks associated with fraudulent activities.
